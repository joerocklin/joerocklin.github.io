Writing things down has always been cathartic for me. It helps me to formulate my thoughts into concrete statements and focus my views on topics. Usually I find myself with ideas that seem grand and when they make it into words, there's not quite as much there as I originally envisioned. Often this leads me with a folder full of half-baked drafts; no more.

2015 for me will be the year of journaling.

I don't anticipate that all of my journaling will make it onto this forum. In fact: I intend to do most of the journaling in the private context of evernote or even (gasp) paper. I might even find myself compelled to write a bona fide letter to someone to convey some thought in which I feel they may be particularly interested.

The reasons for this are many and varied in basis:

 * I want to improve my writing skills
 * I want to improve my handwriting skills
 * I want to have a collection of thoughts and ideas to look back on in the years to come
 * I like the idea that maybe my writings may have an impact on someone else

Maybe 2015 will contain some poignant thoughts based on incredible events. Maybe it will just be my thoughts as a new dad watching a child grow and struggling with how to guide a new person through this crazy thing we do everyday called: life. Maybe it will just be some recipes I like and otherwise pointless drivel. The content probably won't matter, the process will.

Welcome to 2015. Let's make it better than 2014 for ourselves and the world around us.
