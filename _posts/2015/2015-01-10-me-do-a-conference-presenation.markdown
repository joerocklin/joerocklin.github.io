title: Me? Do a Conference Presenation?

I've given many presentations, but they've all been on things that I've essentially _had_ to present. I usually stay quiet in many conversations because I operate under the condition that I probably don't really know what I'm talking about - especially with people I don't know well. So it should be easy to see why I'm not the first to volunteer to give presentations.

But things are changing a bit in this regard. At work I am in the process of pulling together presentations on a few topics in which I have some knowledge and in which my team is somewhat less knowledgeable. While I wasn't asked to give the presentation directly, I volunteered if it was desired and was taken up on the offer. As the presentation date approaches for the first topic I'm getting slightly more anxious. It's a short presentation and those are always more difficult.

Presentations at work are great and all, but I want to take one step more: I think I want to pull together a conference presentation. I enjoy the exchange of information at conferences and I want to take a shot at sharing directly. Instead of pulling something together related to my work (which then probably has to go through all sorts of checks before I can really present it), I want to focus on something that is a hobby of mine: radio. The benefit here being that it is extra motivation to do focused work with a hobby in which I don't often spend much time.

I've been a Ham for over 10 years now, but have never really done much more than ragchew on some repeaters or just listen to others converse. Recently I've been getting the bug to do more and have been interested in some of the digital aspects of the hobby. But I don't have a shack set up with gear, and I don't have a lot of budget set aside for the hobby. So I'm going through the process of learning by doing things as cheaply as possible! Lucky for me: there is a large amount of signals all around us and some really cheap gear for receiving them!

Now I know almost nothing practical about digital signals. I'm a software guy, and other than reading extensively I can't pick out FSK from OOK on a waterfall chart if my life depended on it: but I know what those three things are and that's a start. And maybe out of my ignorance can come a conference presentation: How I went from knowing nothing to knowing enough to share with you.

As saying goes:

    If you don't know something: ask.
    If you still don't know: read a book.
    If you still don't know: teach someone else.
    If you still don't know: teach a class.
    If you still don't know: write a book.

Next time you see me: ask me how this project is going. I have already made some significant strides towards my first milestone - at least, for someone starting from scratch!
