In March of 2014 we welcomed our first child into our family. We had no clue what we were doing (and still feel like we don't on a lot of days) but did a lot of research to learn as much as we could before the baby arrived. So we've collected links and comments about what worked for us. This is in no way us saying 'this is what you have to do'! Hopefully you'll find some of this useful in your own research!

## Background
We aimed to have a natural birth with as little intervention as possible. And then once we brought Lizzie home, we wanted to be able to raise her in a way that had us focus on the long term both with how to teach her things and on where we spent our money. Here are some things that helped us prep for baby, or things that we wish we had known!

## Before going to the hospital

* Get a car seat and make sure you know how to install it properly. Fire stations will often help will this if you need it. There’s an organization called [Car Seats for the Littles](http://csftl.org/) with a very active [group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CarSeatsForTheLittles/) all about car seats if you have questions or want recommendations.
* Most people start with a rear facing only infant seat and base. You can install the seat with or without the base but it is much quicker to use the base. We considered getting two bases but never really needed the second one. Another option is to skip the rear facing only seat and go straight to a convertible seat, which you will need eventually anyway.
* If you haven’t yet: find a pediatrician.
* Jennie really enjoyed reading [Expecting Better by Emily Oster](www.amazon.com/Expecting-Better-Conventional-Pregnancy-Wrong--/dp/0143125702/)
* Jennie also found [Ina May's Guide to Childbirth](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000S1LT1A/ref=cm_sw_r_udp_awd_hJfDvb0WAE2PP) helpful. It has lots of positive birth stories.
* We hired a [doula](http://americanpregnancy.org/labor-and-birth/having-a-doula/) to help us at the hospital for the delivery. She was definitely worth the cost. It was so helpful to have someone there to give Joe breaks when he needed them, remind us of techniques to deal with labor pain, and help in so many other ways.
* Find a copy of the DVD Happiest Baby on the Block - It’s pretty cheap on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Happiest-Baby-Block-Crying/dp/B0006J021C), but it’s not something you necessarily need to own (we borrowed a copy from the library). Among other things, it teaches how to swaddle and an almost magic way to calm a baby down. This will also be useful the first week with the baby.
* We also borrowed a copy of [Baby Language](http://www.dunstanbaby.com) from the library. You can find some excerpts online as well. It helped with interpreting Lizzie's various cries.
* We did co-sleeping (sleeping in the same room) with Lizzie, but not bed sharing. So we had a [pack 'n play](www.amazon.com/Graco-Playard-Reversible-Napper-Changer/dp/B00GY8J8H8/) in our bedroom.
    * If we were doing it again though we would skip the reversible napper thing (because it isn't washable) and just get the [cheaper version](www.amazon.com/Graco-Pack-Travel-Playard-Green/dp/B005UV0UEA).
    * Jennie informs me that she thinks the pack-n-play is a good thing to have but that she almost wishes that we had started Lizzie in the crib in our room instead. The crib we have is from [IKEA](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30248575/).
* We borrowed a [rock 'n play sleeper](http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Newborn-Sleeper-Little-Snugabunny/dp/B00DJPGL42) it very useful for napping early on. That one seems to be discontinued but the newer models are very similar.
* Clothes:
    * [Carter’s White Onesies](http://www.carters.com/carters-baby-neutral-baby-essentials-bodysuitspants/VM_111A300.html): This is still what Lizzie wears most of the time even now! They’re cheap and easy to deal with. And cute on top of her cloth diapers.
    * Very early on we used some gerber kimono style onesies (also known as side-snap bodysuits) that had long sleeves with these pocket-type things that could fold over Lizzie’s hands. This ended up being a lot easier than the traditional onesie and the pockets came in handy a couple of times to keep her from scratching her face.
    I can’t find the exact ones we used, but my sister says she recently got some of them from [Jockey](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VEBZR6G/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_RufDvb0PQ4YHH) and liked them.
    * We were given a few [zutano onsies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002OL2CDG/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_PxeDvb0GF7D16) as shower gifts that we liked but they were too big for a week or two.
* If you want to breastfeed,
    * Consider reading [The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345518446/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_lHfDvb1CPSKFC). You don't need to read the whole thing at once - it's organized by week for the first several weeks of baby's life.
    * Pregnant mothers are welcome at [La Leche League](http://www.llli.org) meetings, as are mothers with babies. It can be very helpful to hear others breastfeeding questions and get your own questions answered. There's also a Facebook group.


## At the hospital

The nurses at Bethesda North were great and will help with lots of things, including learning how to swaddle and change a diaper.

We brought a gift bag of treats for the labor and delivery nurses (granola bars, candies, fruit snacks). We forgot to bring some for the maternity nurses and had to send grandpa out for donuts.

Driving back home will be nerve-wracking and crazy exciting.

## Back Home

* Jennie has found an incredible resource of other mothers in a Babywearing group on facebook. We call it the Babywearing Club, but officially they’re called [Babywearing International of Greater Cincinnati](https://www.facebook.com/groups/798924030138077/) - a lot of the general advice is in their [‘off-topic’ group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/636974429752512/).
* Sometime around 6 months we started Baby Led Weaning. We have never purchased or made baby food and Lizzie eats just about anything we put in front of her. There are many resources online for BLW. Jennie liked the book [Baby-Led Weaning by Gill Rapley](http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Led-Weaning-Essential-Introducing-Confident/dp/161519021X/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1434412151&sr=8-1&keywords=Baby-Led+Weaning).

### Diapers

Let's face it: you're going to be seeing a lot of these, so here's a whole section with research links!

* Cloth Diapers have been great for us. There’s a [higher upfront cost, but lower overall cost](http://www.thebump.com/a/cloth-diapers-vs-disposable). We have both [prefold](http://www.greenmountaindiapers.com/prefolds.html) and [fitted (non-snap) versions](http://www.greenmountaindiapers.com/workhorse-white.html). There is overlap on the various sizes, and we’ve used newborn (orange), medium (red), and large (brown). We used size one [Thirsties](http://www.greenmountaindiapers.com/thirsties-duo-wrap-aplix.html) covers with the newborn diapers and size two covers with the larger diapers.
* [Green Mountain Diaper](http://www.greenmountaindiapers.com/newmom.html) has a ton of information.
* Of course there's a [Facebook group about cloth diapers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FluffLoveCDScience/).
* Turning on lights overnight will help you see for those diaper changes, but will also make it more difficult for baby to fall back asleep. We ended up using night lights placed away from the changing area and then eventually went to using [overnight doublers](http://www.abbyslane.com/Geffen-Baby-Inserts-Absorbers_p_738.html) to avoid overnight changes (though we didn't start that until 8 months or so).
* We also made some cloth wipes to use and reuse (and reuse). We have them both for diaper changes and for mealtime. You can buy cloth wipes if you don’t want to make them. We also get a big box of huggies disposable wipes from Costco for trips out (and when we run out of clean reusable wipes).
