I was recently asked about pulling together a coffee care package geared toward making coffee. This question intrigued me and I quickly came up with a few options. Below you will find the lists for a few different goals with coffee preparation.

## Fresh Coffee

In all cases, buy coffee fresh. Buy just what you're going to need for between one to three weeks, use it, then buy more. Coffee is a perishable good and will go rancid quite quickly. Most quality roasters will ship orders within a day or so of roasting. By the time it reaches your door it will be ready for use.

If it's possible, find a quality roaster in your area. If you're lucky enough to have more than one nearby, check out a few of them. Talk to them about what their goals are for their roasts. Ask if you can do a cupping with them sometime to learn more.

Try to stay away from any flavored beans. These flavors are usually added as oily chemicals that coat the beans after roasting. This flavor will coat every surface the bean comes in contact with and soon everything will taste like the flavor. If you want to flavor your coffee there are a number of great syrups that can be added to your cup after brewing.

If you're in Cincinnati (or passing through) check out [Deeper Roots Coffee](http://www.deeperrootscoffee.com). They offer weekly cuppings that are open to the public and strongly believe in education and training. Ask questions and discover new things!

# Single Serve Coffee

Just the basics please! This is the basic way to serve coffee for one or maybe two. All you need is a way to get hot water. Excluding the glasses, this can also be used as a decent camping setup!

1. **Aeropress** - Makes a great cup of coffee, but don't follow the directions on the box. You will not get espresso from this. Check out the [World Aeropress Championships](http://worldaeropresschampionship.com/recipes/) for some great 'recipes'.
2. **Hario Slim Grinder** - A compact little grinder than will work well with the aeropress.
3. **Bodum Pavina Glasses** - These are some of my favorite glasses. They look great, and are the proper size for coffee from the aeropress - just make sure to get the 8.5oz size!

# Small Group

Coffee is great; sharing coffee with someone else is wonderful. If you have two to three people looking for a cup of coffee after dinner, this setup will work quite well. Again all you need is a way to get hot water.

This group includes a hand grinder. If you make coffee often enough, this will get tedious and you will want to upgrade to an electric grinder. It is important not to skimp on a grinder. See [Baratza's](https://www.baratza.com) excellent line of options. And if you want a deal, they put their [refurbished options](http://bit.ly/19ee7cB) online Thursday mornings.

1. **Hario V60 Dripper 02** - This can work great as a single serving option, or for upwards of ¾ of a liter! (That's a bit over 24 ounces). Sit this on top of whatever you want to hold your coffee and brew away!
2. **Hario V60 Range Server** - Not strictly necessary, but it works great as a presentation method and will hold all of the coffee the dripper can make. They were literally made to go together!
3. **Hario Skerton Grinder** - I used this grinder as my mobile solution even for larger groups. It will take some time to get through any significant volume, but that time can be spent talking amongst the group.
4. **Filters** - The V60 uses a conical filter without a flat bottom. They're cheap enough and easy to get from Amazon.
5. **Bodum Pavina Glasses** - Still great glasses!

# Splurge Setup

Whether you're serving coffee regularly, or just want to ensure you can repeatably produce an excellent cup, here's a list to get you moving. It builds on the small group setup and adds some options for larger groups.

1. **American Weigh Scale** - Weigh all the things! Just like in baking, weight measurements are much more precise than volumetric and therefore can produce more reliable results!
2. **Baratza Vario** - If you can really splurge, get the Forté. If this is a little rich for your blood, go for a Virtuoso or Preciso.
3. **Electric Kettle** - Electric gooseneck kettles are great, but be careful: they typically come in 1L volumes max. If you know you're going to be serving more quantity you might want to drop the gooseneck option and get something with greater capacity.
4. **Chemex** - It's very similar to the V60 dripper, but has a greater capacity. I find the presentation a bit more elegant than the V60 as well.
5. **Chemex Filters** - Another filter that isn't your standard filter, but is also very easy to acquire.
