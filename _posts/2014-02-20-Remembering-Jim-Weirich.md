title: Remembering Jim Weirich
---

I didn't know Jim Weirich very long, or all that well. But upon hearing of his passing this morning I'm finding myself more affected than I would have expected. I saw him just yesterday. Heard his laugh yesterday. Watched him fly a few quadcopters yesterday. But more than that, I think I saw what drew me to Jim: I saw him curious.

I was very excited when I learned that Jim lived and worked in the same city as me, and I'm very sorry that I only learned of this a few months ago. My interaction with Jim was mostly unidirectional: Him speaking to a group of which I was merely a face in the crowd. Whether that was in person or just a bump up of the view count on Youtube doesn't matter, the impact was the same. 

I recall hearing some variation of the same theme in many of his talks and discussions, something along the lines of: "I wondered what would happen if...", or "I wanted to see if I could...". Jim was pushing his own understanding of a system and in the process pushed us all to look deeper; to better understand our systems and our own development patterns.

I will miss being able to explore the prospects of [developing SDR controls][twitter quadcopter sdr] for some of his quadcopters. I will miss being able to sit at the [local ruby meetup][cincyrb] and marvel at Jim's ability to see patterns and refactor code. I will miss hearing about his recent foray into clojure over [coffee on Fridays][gaslight coffee].

In remembrance of Jim, today I will try to learn something new. I will try to improve some code, and try to improve the way I write software. And I will try to spread the enthusiasm Jim had for constantly improving things by trying to understand them.

Maybe my lack of deep understanding of Jim lead me to get a wrong impression of him, I don't know. Regardless, I hope that the memories of Jim and the inevitable re-watching of his presentations will continue to push me to be better at what I do. And to always be curious.
